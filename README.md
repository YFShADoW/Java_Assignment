<div style="text-align: justify">
SIGMA SDN BHD (SSB) is one of Johor Bahruâ€™s emerging wholesalers engaged in selling
of everyday groceries, fresh produce and fresh foods to various retailers of Malaysia. As the
business grows, they need to automate the process of Purchase Orders to maintain the

is required to SSB. After reviving the PR the Purchase Manager (PM) generates a Purchase
Order (PO). A PO is an authorised document used by organisations for placing orders with
their suppliers for procurement of goods. Develop an application in Java applying the OOP
techniques you learned to achieve the following functionalities:
